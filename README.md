reports
=======

Report repository for JSS reports

Folder structure
----------------

- jasperRepository -> Created from existing repository using js-export. The folder structure is as per Jasper's standards. 
- scripts -> You know what
- jrxml -> A quick way of figuring out the reports present in the repository, if you are not familiar with the repository layout. 

- Use js-export and js-import utilities available in the buildomatic folder that comes with JasperReports to set up your local machine. 
- Default jasperadmin users and roles will be created by the script. Use options provided with js-import if you do not need them.
